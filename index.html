    <h1>Vladimir Tatlin</h1>
    <p>In years to come, <span> Vladimir Tatlin </span>
        <img src="images/Vladimir-Tatlin.jpg" class="image1">
        may be viewed as one of the greatest visionary artists of the 20th century. He
        was born in Moscow and grew up in Kharkov. His father was a railway engineer and his mother a poet, their
        professions and outlook representative of some of the new middle-class mobility found in late 19th-century
        Russia.
    </p>
    <p>In 1902 Tatlin "ran away to sea" for a year and traveled abroad in Egypt, Turkey, Syria, and Libya. From the end
        of 1902 to 1904 he attended the Moscow School of Painting, Sculpture, and Architecture. He continued his art
        studies from 1904 to 1910 at the Penza Art School and studied under
        <span> Goroshkin-Sorokopudov </span>
        <img src="C:\Orléans\web\goroshkin\oooooooooooo.gif" class="image2">
        and the lesser-known Peredvizhnik (Wanderers-social realist)<span> Afanasyev.</span>
        <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/10/Afanas%27ev_by_Kostandi.png" class="image3">
        Tatlin received his diploma in 1908 as a
        painter. In Penza,
        Tatlin had established a close relationship with the Rayonist painter <span> Mikhail Larionov</span> <img
            src="C:\Orléans\web\larionov\fdvre.gif" class="image4">
         and his wife, the
        primitivist and cubo-futurist painter <span> Natalia Goncharova.</span> <img
            src="file:///C:/Orl%C3%A9ans/web/nataliya.gif" class="image5"> He exhibited
        with them in Odessa in December 1910 in
        the Second Izbedskii Salon exhibition and in "The Donkey's Tail" Exhibition in Moscow, April 1912.
    </p>
    <p>Tatlin's most famous early work was the painting <span>The Fishmonger (1911)</span>
        <img src="https://uploads6.wikiart.org/images/vladimir-tatlin/the-fishmonger-1911.jpg!Large.jpg" class="image6">
        , which emphasizes a great swirl of arcs
        and created a great deal of movement on the canvas. One of the results of the Knave of Diamonds Exhibition was
        an intensive debate that ensued between <span> David Burlyuk</span>
        <img src="C:\Orléans\web\burlyuk\Comp-1.gif" class="image7"> , who was
        strongly supportive of Western art, and Natalia
        Goncharova, who favored Russian themes. The debate led to a split and the formation of "The Donkey's Tail, " a
        rival group emphasizing Russian and folk idioms, with which Tatlin identified.
    </p>
    <p>After 1910 Tatlin returned to the Moscow School of Painting to study with <span>Korovin</span>
        <img src="C:\Orléans\web\korovin\new.gif"
            class="image8"> and <span>Serov</span> <img
            src="C:\Orléans\web\sereov\GGIIFF.gif"
            class="image9"> Post-Impressionist painters. During 1911 Tatlin organized a teaching studio in Moscow which
        provided him the opportunity to meet avant garde artists <span> Alexander Vesnin </span> <img
            src="C:\Orléans\web\vesnin\newww.gif"
            class="image10"> and <span> Liubov Popova.</span>
            <img src="C:\Orléans\web\popova\fd.gif" class="image14"> Tatlin also
        exhibited in "The World
        of Art" show in 1912-1913 and in "Contemporary Painting" from 1912 to 1914.
    </p>
    <p>Tatlin's works of this period include the painting<span> Nude (1913),</span> <img
            src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/68/Female_Model_by_Vladimir_Tatlin_1913.jpg"
            class="image11"> which marks a blend of Western avant garde and
        Russian tradition. In the realm of theatrical set design, Tatlin worked on Glinka's opera A Life for the Tsar
        and Tomahsevsky's play Tsar Maximillian and his unruly son Adolf. Both were strong in folk motif and
        abstraction.
    </p>
    <p>During November 1920 Tatlin exhibited a model of the <span> "Monument to the Third International" </span> <img
            src="https://i.pinimg.com/564x/a3/52/ca/a352ca6e0d7d6054bdfbffbe851d1faa.jpg" class="image12"> in Petrograd
        at the
        former Academy of Arts. A month later the model was moved to Moscow for exhibition at the 8th Congress of the
        Soviets. Although the monument, designed to straddle the Neva River in Petrograd, was never built, it has
        remained an inspiration for monumental architecture and remains the main symbol of Constructivism. The basic
        idea of the structure, according to Nikolai Punin, one of Tatlin's associates, was to create a monumental
        construction utilizing architectural, sculptural, and painterly principles. It was dedicated to the branch of
        the new government designed to promote international revolution. The monument was a soaring and spiral-like
        skeletal steel structure, sometimes called a modern <span> Tower of Babel. </span> <img
            src="https://th.bing.com/th/id/R.343f120c73bc91a611ec41c1fe280e34?rik=8RP8DS4%2bahj2mA&riu=http%3a%2f%2fwww.erikakimberly.com%2fwp-content%2fuploads%2f2011%2f11%2ftower_of_babel-170113154.jpg&ehk=Y%2fpSup2wSviLV6WLnMqPtUhfYX6SPEZSy1qR%2fUgY6TM%3d&risl=&pid=ImgRaw&r=0"
            class="image13"> Within the steel structure were three large
        glass spaces held in place by a complex system of pivots and mechanisms which allowed them to move at different
        speeds. The lower space, a cube, was a building for the International's annual meetings and rotated once a year.
        The second building was a pyramid, which revolved at one revolution a month. This was designed to house the
        executive divisions and secretariat of the International. The upper building, a cylinder, rotated once a day and
        was to house means of disseminating information—newspapers, printshops, telegraph, large projectors, radio
        transmitters, and viewing screens. The tower itself was both sculpture and architecture.
    </p>
    <p>Tatlin died in 1953 from food poisoning, and his passing was unheralded. He is now being rediscovered in his
        native country, as glasnost's attempt to analyze the past has led to a close examination of the avant garde
        before 1933.</p>
